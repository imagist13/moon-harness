"""Chat Run Executor — decouples the AI workflow from the HTTP connection lifecycle.

Each sent message creates a ChatRun row + starts a background asyncio.Task. The
task consumes ``astream_chat_workflow``, converts every chunk into an SSE event
and XADDs it to the Redis Stream ``jx:chat:run:{run_id}:events``. SSE followers
read the stream via XRANGE replay + XREAD tailing, which enables "resume the
live stream after a page refresh".

Public interface:
- ``start_run(...)``          launch a run already accepted by ChatSequencer
- ``wait_run(run_id)``        wait for a locally launched run without detaching it
- ``follow_run(run_id, ...)`` SSE follower: read events from the Redis Stream
- ``cancel_run(run_id, ...)`` cancel the background task + mark status=cancelled
- ``recover_orphan_runs()``   startup hook: resume from the last durable safe point
- ``get_run(run_id)``         read the ChatRun row (used by the route layer for authz)
- ``get_active_run_for_chat(chat_id, user_id)``  probe for an in-progress run

      ``CHAT_RUN_STALE_QUIET_SEC``. Long tasks still steadily producing

      age-based reaping choked even active runs mid-tool-call once the 30-minute
      mark hit).
    - **Absolute cap**: runs older than ``CHAT_RUN_HARD_MAX_AGE_SEC`` are reaped
      even when actively emitting, except while a registered bounded human
      interaction is pending (that interaction keeps its own full deadline).

    Reaping also cancels the in-process worker task, keeping the DB terminal
    state aligned with the actual task (historical bug: only flipping the DB
    without killing the task let the worker silently run another 1.5h and
    overwrite the terminal state back to completed). plan_execute is the
    exception — cross-task cancel risks the anyio cancel-scope deadlock (see the
    ``cancel_run`` docstring); it stops itself after ``is_run_cancelled``
    polling observes the terminal state.

    Complements periodic ``recover_orphan_runs`` and the per-run
