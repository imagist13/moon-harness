"""Credit assignment — decide *whether* to update, then *what* (GCE ticket 11).

This is what separates the design from "three engines each learning on their
own".  When several components can all change themselves, a single failure sends
every one of them a signal, and they produce mutually contradictory edits.  The
assigner's job is to pick at most one responsible target — or to decide that
nothing should change at all.

**The attribution space is deliberately larger than the four mutable assets.**
This deployment runs multiple model providers, multiple knowledge bases, a
sandbox and a pile of external tools.  In practice a large share of real
failures are "the KB simply has no such document", "this model cannot produce
that structured output", or "an external API changed its schema yesterday".  If
the only choices were memory / skill / workflow / ontology, the assigner would
be *forced* to squeeze those into a mutable asset — labelling a knowledge gap as
"this skill needs patching", emitting a candidate that can never fix anything,
and polluting the statistics on the way. That failure mode has a name here:
**pseudo-evolution**, and excluding it is a design requirement, not a nicety.

The first version is explainable rules plus calibrated confidence — no trained
model. Low confidence, unexplainable signals and suspected environment faults
all resolve to NO_UPDATE.
