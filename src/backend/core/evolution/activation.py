"""Materialise an approved candidate into a runtime capability.

This is the step the loop was missing.  Everything upstream — discovery,
attribution, promotion, the IR, replay — produced a *candidate*, and a candidate
is a proposal.  Nothing turned it into an asset the agent could actually load,
so measured end to end the system learned nothing: the benchmark's "after" arm
saw exactly zero new skills.

Materialisation closes that gap, and it is deliberately the **only** way an
evolution artefact reaches the runtime.  It sits behind the release controller
so every governance property upstream still holds:

* the candidate must have cleared the verification its risk tier demands;
* the approver must not be the proposer;
* the previous state is captured **before** the write, so rollback has somewhere
  to go rather than having to reconstruct one afterwards.

Materialised skills are tagged so they can always be told apart from
hand-authored ones. A capability the system wrote about itself should never be
indistinguishable from one a person wrote.
