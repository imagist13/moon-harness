"""Per-turn evolution settlement.

The in-chat card answers one question: **what did this turn teach the system?**

The only honest answer at turn scope is *memory*. Skills and orchestration
policies are mined in batch — a turn cannot create one, and the skills it opened
were already installed, so reporting them announced an evolution that never
happened. Every turn that used a skill claimed one, which is how the card
learned to be ignored. So the card reports memory writes and nothing else.

Memory is also the one mechanism a user can act on, which is why the summary
carries the **entries themselves** — text plus the handle needed to edit or
delete each one — rather than a count. A card that says "wrote 3 memories" is
unverifiable and unfixable; one that shows the three sentences and lets the user
correct a wrong one is neither.

Settlement cannot run while the stream is open: the write pipeline is scheduled
after it closes. So the closing frame carries only a marker, settlement happens
in the background (`settlement_runner`), and the result is persisted onto the
message so a reload — or a client that had disconnected — still sees it.
