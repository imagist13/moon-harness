"""Per-user evolution participation, derived from the single evolution switch.

There used to be two user-facing switches: "start evolution" (does the loop
distil for me) and "contribute to evolution" (do my conversations feed
cross-user learning).  The distinction was real but nobody could tell the two
apart in the settings panel, so the product now has exactly one switch —
``evolution_prefs.enabled`` — and contribution follows it: evolution on means
the loop may distil for this user *and* their conversations may serve as
evidence within the tenant; off means neither.

Enforcement still lives at one point rather than being scattered: the
Episode's ``privacy_class``.  With the switch off, episodes are marked
``private`` and pattern mining filters those out — so the user still gets
their own in-chat card and their own history, while nothing of theirs feeds
cross-user learning. Anything weaker would make the promise unverifiable.
