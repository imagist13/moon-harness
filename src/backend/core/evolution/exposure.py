"""Who may actually load an evolved skill right now.

The release state machine models ``shadow → canary 5/25/100 → active`` and the
IR declares a ``scope``.  Neither meant anything at runtime: a materialised skill
was written as a global public ``AdminSkill``, and the capability resolver hands
every global public skill to every user.  So a brand-new, ``risk_tier=high``
capability the system wrote about itself went to 100% of users the moment it was
activated — more aggressive than the design it ships with claims to be.

This module is the missing enforcement point.  It answers one question —
*may this subject load this evolved skill?* — from the release record, and the
agent factory consults it on every run.

Three properties worth stating:

* **Fail closed.**  An evolved skill with no readable, in-flight release is not
  exposed.  The default for a capability the system authored about itself is
  "no", because the failure mode of guessing "yes" is that an unvetted change
  reaches everyone.
* **Shadow reaches nobody.**  That is what makes shadow zero-risk; a shadow
  stage that leaked to users would just be an unannounced canary.
* **Bucketing is stable per (release, subject).**  A user does not flip between
  versions mid-ramp, and the assignment is recomputable during analysis rather
  than stored per request.

Hand-authored skills are untouched: only ids carrying the evolution prefix are
ever filtered, so this cannot hide a capability a person created.
