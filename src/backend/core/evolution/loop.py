"""The evolution loop, wired end to end (GCE integration).

Everything up to here has been a component.  This module is the loop itself:

    Episodes → patterns → credit → promotion → IR → invariants → candidate →
    release (shadow → canary → active) → the next run binds the new version

It runs off the response path, on the shared worker base, under the same cost
budget as distillation.  It cannot activate anything on its own beyond the low
risk tier: everything else stops at a candidate awaiting review, which is the
whole point of calling this *governed* co-evolution.
