"""User confirmation for MySpace write operations — Claude Code-shaped "true suspend" gate (docs §13).

Old implementation: an unapproved /myspace write returned an
``awaiting_user_confirmation`` sentinel ToolResponse, expecting the model to
relay "confirmation needed" to the user, and the same write was only persisted
by a **retry** after approval. Consequences (reproduced in trace fbd476f8): the
model treated the sentinel as an ordinary failure and retried repeatedly within
the same run's ReAct loop (4 Write calls in one run); after approval a separate
resume-after-confirm continuation run was still required; and a single-use
authorization consumed by a concurrent retry popped the confirmation again.

New implementation mirrors Claude Code
(``src/services/tools/toolExecution.ts::runToolUse``
+ ``hooks/toolPermission/handlers/interactiveHandler.ts``): an unapproved
/myspace write **suspends the current tool coroutine** — ``await`` on a
per-confirm ``asyncio.Event`` — while the frontend is told via SSE to show a
confirmation bar. The user's out-of-band
``POST /v1/chats/{id}/file-confirm`` triggers that Event → the **same tool
coroutine** wakes up and performs the write exactly once in place. The model
stays blocked inside the tool call the whole time (no tool_result yet), so it
physically cannot retry and no continuation run is needed.

Feasibility key (verified against routing/streaming.py): ``agent.reply()`` runs
in its own ``asyncio.create_task``; the consumer loop keeps SSE alive with an
independent heartbeat via ``asyncio.wait_for(...timeout)``. An ``await`` inside
a tool only suspends the agent task — it does not block the event loop or stall
SSE. Both conclusions in the old docstring ("AgentScope has no pre-tool hook /
blocking would deadlock the stream") no longer hold for the current architecture.

Concurrent dedup: with ``parallel_tool_calls=True`` the model may emit multiple
Write blocks concurrently in one reasoning step. Dedup by
``(op, logical_path)`` — concurrent/duplicate writes to the same file share
**one** pending + one Event + only **one** confirmation bar.

Storage: in-process per-chat (fine for single-worker dev; multi-worker needs
Redis + pub/sub, since ``asyncio.Event`` does not cross processes). Event/Queue
are created lazily and bound to the uvicorn event loop; gate (agent task) /
stream consumer / the /file-confirm endpoint share the same loop, so
cross-coroutine use is safe.
