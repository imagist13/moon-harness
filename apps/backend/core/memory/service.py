"""mem0 memory service wrapper

Directly reuses mem0 framework capabilities:
- vector retrieval (Milvus)
- native expiration (add/update ``expiration_date``; expired entries are hidden
  from search and get_all)

L3 graph memory is implemented locally in :mod:`core.memory.graph`. mem0ai 2.x
removed graph-store support from its open-source ``Memory`` class, so passing a
``graph_store`` config block there would be silently ignored.

What it deliberately does NOT delegate to mem0: extraction and dedup. Writes go
in with ``infer=False`` after our own extractors have judged the turn, and
near-duplicate detection is our own pre-write search (`find_similar_procedure` +
`reinforce_procedure_entry`) — mem0's dedup lives inside the ``infer`` pass we
skip, so skipping it without a replacement made every L2 write a blind append.

This file only does config assembly + async wrapping beyond that.
