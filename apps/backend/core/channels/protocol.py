"""Channel adapter protocol + normalized data classes.

Each external IM channel implements one ``ChannelAdapter``: normalize the channel
protocol into ``InboundMsg`` (inbound) and send agent replies back via ``push``
(outbound, returning ``SendResult``). Capability differences (message length cap,
markdown support, long-connection support) are declared explicitly via
``ChannelCaps``, which the upper layer uses to degrade/chunk — avoiding
"if channel name" checks everywhere.

Benchmarked against Hermes-Agent ``BasePlatformAdapter`` + capability flags /
OpenClaw ``defineChannelMessageAdapter``.

        This is the *pull* counterpart to group listening's *push*, and the two sit behind
        **different platform permissions** — which is the whole point of having it. Where a
        platform will not push non-@ group messages to a bot, pulling with the app's own
        credentials may still be allowed; and pulling is the only way to see anything from
        before the bot joined the group.

        Implementations must use the channel **app credentials** (tenant/access token), not a
        user's OAuth session, so this stays a property of the channel connection rather than
        of whichever human happens to be linked.

        ``since_ms`` is an epoch-millisecond lower bound (exclusive is preferred; the caller
        de-duplicates by ``message_id`` regardless, because platforms differ on whether the
        boundary is inclusive). ``limit`` is a hard cap on returned items.

        ``newest_first`` selects which end of the window ``limit`` is taken from, which
        matters as soon as a group has more messages than the cap:
          * False (incremental) — oldest first from ``since_ms``, walking forward from the
            cursor so nothing is skipped.
          * True (cold start) — the most recent ``limit`` messages within the window. Taking
            the *oldest* of a week-long window would hand back stale chatter and leave the
            newest messages — the ones the conversation is actually about — unread.
        Implementations may return either order; the caller sorts chronologically.

        Returning an empty list must be indistinguishable from "not supported" for the
        caller — any failure degrades to "no history", never an exception.
