    Note: ``_args`` (list) inside ``params`` is interpreted as command-line
    arguments appended after the interpreter invocation; the remaining keys
    are serialized as JSON and written to stdin.

    ``user_id``: optional. When the opensandbox provider detects this field,
    it automatically seeds every file under
    ``STORAGE_PATH/myspace_cache/{user_id}/`` into the sandbox at
    ``/workspace/myspace/{user_id}/``, so that files staged via
    ``stage_files`` are visible in subsequent execute calls. The
    script_runner provider ignores this field.

    ``session_id``: optional. Persistent-sandbox providers (e.g.
    opensandbox) use this field to bind multiple ``execute`` calls to the
    same underlying sandbox instance, so that Jupyter kernel state
    (variables, imports, pip-installed packages) is reused across rounds.
    Ephemeral providers ignore this field.

    ``expected_output_files``: optional. The caller declares in advance the
    list of output file names it expects to retrieve from the sandbox (file
    names relative to /workspace, no directories). Providers use it for
    precise retrieval — this matters especially because the opensandbox
    SDK's ``files.search`` is unavailable in some versions, and artifact
    collection relying on list-and-diff would return empty. With explicit
    expected file names declared, the provider takes the precise
    ``get_file_info`` + ``read_bytes`` retrieval path, bypassing the list
    failure. Missing files do not raise (treated as stale or not produced
    by the script); the resulting ExecuteResult.files only contains files
    that were successfully retrieved. The script_runner provider is also
    compatible with this field (still uses the original work_dir scan; the
    extra field has no side effects).
