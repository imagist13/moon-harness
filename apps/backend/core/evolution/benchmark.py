"""Before/after benchmark for the evolution loop.

Measures the only question that matters: **does evolution give the runtime a
capability it did not have before?**

Design of the task environment
------------------------------
Each task needs its tools executed in a specific order.  The failure it models
is the one the design document uses as its worked example: an entity check that
runs *after* the data query lets a wrong-entity report through, and the gate
denies it.  Ordering is exactly the kind of knowledge that is expensive to
rediscover each time and cheap to reuse once distilled — which is what the
promotion chain claims to do.

The base model is held fixed and represented as a deterministic planner:

* **without** a matching skill it must derive the order itself, and on tasks
  whose ordering is non-obvious it gets it wrong;
* **with** a matching skill the order arrives pre-assembled.

That is a model, not a live LLM, and it is stated plainly so nobody reads more
into the numbers than they support.  What it isolates is precisely the harness
question — *given the same model, does the system now hold a reusable
capability?* — and it is deterministic, so a difference between arms is
attributable to the harness rather than to sampling.

Deliberate anti-rigging measures
--------------------------------
Two properties keep this from being a benchmark that can only succeed:

1. **Distractor tasks.** Tasks whose ordering is unrelated to any distilled
   skill. If the "after" arm improves on those too, the harness is leaking
   information and the result is invalid.
2. **A trap task.** Its correct order is the *opposite* of the popular one. A
   skill distilled from the majority pattern should make it *worse* — so a
   sweep of uniform improvement is itself a signal that something is wrong.
